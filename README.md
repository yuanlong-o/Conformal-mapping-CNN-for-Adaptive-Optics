# Conformal-mapping-CNN-for-Adaptive-Optics

A computational method to reshape a distorted PSF via conformal mapping so that a convolutional neural network (CNN) could better recognize it.

## Methods
=======
* Sample the original PSF with a polar grid and rearrange the sampleed grid into box form.

## Usage
=======
Check the generate_conformal_mapped_PSF.m to run the demo
